------------------------ The Starry Night -----------------------------------------
Jack woke up at midnight by the light which shone upon him. Jack , a teen but adult for his age, woke up 
to the pearly mantle which was cast upon him.

I wonder how far is the moon, quizzed the 9 year old. Why does it shine , for whom does it shine ? 
What would the deep trenches on it mean , as his drowsy eyes were gazed upon its craters.

"Come to bed", his worrisome mother told him. "Can't you sleep?". No sooner did one question ended did 
another begin. "I wonder how mom can sense when I can't sleep" , he said to himself. That was in itself
bigger than the previous mystery.
